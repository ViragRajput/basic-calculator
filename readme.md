# JavaScript Calculator Project

This is a simple calculator project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Folder Structure

```plaintext
/Basic-Calculator
|-- index.html
|-- style.css
|-- script.js
```

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ViragRajput/basic-calculator.git
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Clear button to reset the display.
- Equal button to calculate and display the result.

## Project Overview

### HTML (index.html)

- Contains the structure of the calculator.
- Includes an input field for the display and buttons for each digit and operation.
- Linked to the `style.css` file for styling and the `script.js` file for functionality.

### CSS (style.css)

- Provides styling for the calculator interface.
- Defines the layout, colors, and styles of buttons and display.

### JavaScript (script.js)

- Manages the logic and functionality of the calculator.
- Uses event listeners to respond to button clicks.
- Implements functions for appending values to the display, clearing the display, and calculating results.
- Handles error cases, such as division by zero.

## Usage

1. Enter numerical values using the digit buttons.
2. Use operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform arithmetic operations.
3. Press the Clear (C) button to reset the display.
4. Press the Equal (=) button to calculate and display the result.

## Note
This project serves as a hands-on practice for applying JavaScript concepts in real-world scenarios. It provides a practical opportunity to reinforce your understanding of JavaScript by implementing a functional and interactive calculator application. Through this project, you can gain experience in event handling, DOM manipulation, error handling, and more. Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon the code to deepen your JavaScript skills and build a foundation for future web development endeavors.
